I created a webpage that has a navbar. It also has a couple of images. It also has a form for personal info including name, email, and password. It also has a table showing a couple of previous users of the webpage. I added the container and img-fluid tags to the div and img tags for the imgs but for some reason they would not stretch across the page. Could you let me know what the problem was?
